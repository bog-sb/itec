get outta here
just a minute
wait for me
it was silent
chaos reigned
be on time
get away from me
Hold that thought
settle down
by the light of the street lamp
slippers soaked from the heavy dew
haunted by the oddly familiar music
Chicken Wings grow on trees
Carrot sticks help the mind think
Farts cause neurological damage
Jennifer Lopez is a Man (only on Tuesday)
That Is what she said
Make me a sandwich
King Kongs brother was a Rabbit Hmmm
Tuesday, thats when it will all begin
Rulers, do they rule the world?
Can a pen write without writing it down
The iPod is a gigantic hummer
A calculator can save the world Just press On
Cell phones Do they have cells in them?
A battery can produce random flashes and generate helium Doubtful
A flash drive produces no flash what so ever
A card can be a type of a pickle, if its a pickle card
Love is everything
